# Find a Doctor Template
App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

This Find a Doctor template is a fundamental building block for researchers and developers to create powerful apps for medical research with visual consent flows, customizable survey modules, and HIPAA compliant cloud support from Kinvey.

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-find-a-doctor --template tns-template-find-a-doctor-ng
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-find-a-doctor-ng).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
tns create my-find-a-doctor --template git+ssh://git@github.com/NativeScript/template-find-a-doctor-ng.git

# OR when the template repo is public:

tns create my-find-a-doctor --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-find-a-doctor-ng
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!
